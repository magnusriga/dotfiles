# * Do NOT source .[..]profile from .[..]rc files.
#   - .profile, .bash_profile, .zprofile, etc, are login-time scripts, i.e. meant to run ONCE when the first terminal instance Launches.
#   - As such, they might run programs intended to execute only once per session.
#   - Running .[..]profile every time a terminal launches might override environment variables set by the user manually.
#   - Thus, do not run .[..]profile every time an (interactive) shell opens.
# * Add all environment variables and non-graphical programs (ssh-agent, etc.) to .profile, which is run by the other shell's profile files.
#   - .profile is run automatically by bash, sh, dash, and perhaps others, when they are login shells (interactive or not).
#   - Thus, .profile is ideal for code that should only run once, when the first shell opens.
#   - Zsh does not run .profile by default, instead it runs .zprofile, so run .profile from .zprofile.
#   - That way, all needed environment variables are sourced in one place, and only once.
# * Add all other code, related to interactive shells, to .shrc.
#   - Prompt settings, aliases, functions, etc.
#   - This file is not sourced automatically by any shell, so we source it manually in other shell's rc files (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.).
# * Source .[..]rc from .[..]profile.
#   - rc files do not run when the first shell, aka. the login shell, launches.
#   - profile files always run when the first shell, aka. the login shell, launches, regardless if it is an interactive shell or not.
#   - Therefore, run the rc file belonging to the profile file, from the profile file, if the shell (which is a login shell) is interactive.
#   - This ensures that setup code for interactive shells run both for the first shell, aka. the login shell (if interactive), and for subserquent (non-login) shells.
#   - .[..]profile > .profile && .[..]profile > .[..]rc > .shrc
# * Result:
#   - code in .profile runs when the first shell is openend, so environment variables and ssh-agents, etc. are available to all shells from the start.
#   - code in .shrc also runs whenever an interactive shell is opened whether it is the first shell, aka. the login shell, or not.
#   - code in the specifc .[..]profile and .[..]rc also runs.
