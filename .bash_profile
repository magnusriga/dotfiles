# PNPM NOTES:
# PNPM_HOME is path to pnpm executable file (i.e. bin file).
# Below we add binary location (as set by pnpm curl install script) to path.
# We could install pnpm with corepack, in which case it is installed in nvm folder which is already in PATH.
# Thus, using corepack, adding PNPM_HOME to path is not needed.
# It is anyways needed to set PNPM_HOME env, because we use it to set virtual store path.
# If we set it below, and use corepack to install pnpm binary, binary location and PNPM_HOME would not match.
# Thus, install pnpm with curl, but remember to delete entry it makes to .bashrc,
# since that automatic entry sets PNPM_HOME with hardcoded username then adds that to path: PNPM_HOME="/home/<username>/.local/share/pnpm".
# Instead, we make set PNPM_HOME below, using USER env.
# PS: No crisis if we forget to delet bashrc entry made by pnpm install script, as it should use the correct username.
# Below only adds PNPM_HOME to path is it does not already exist in PATH.
